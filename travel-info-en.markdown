The wedding ceremony will start at 13.00 at the castle. And the party will be at
the restaurant in the evening. There will be a bus service to the restaurant
afterwards, and there will be a bus service bringing guests back to town

## Golling

### How to Get There?

 - **Train:** Take a train to Salzburg, and catch a connection from there to
     Golling. There are several trains per hour. You can use this form to find a
     connection, the train station is called "Golling Abtenau": <a href="http://fahrplan.oebb.at/bin/query.exe/en?" target="_blank">fahrplan.oebb.at</a>.

 - **Plane:** Salzburg Airport (SZG) is the closest airport. You can take a bus
     from there to Salzburg central station (german: ''Salzburg Hauptbahnhof'')
     and reach Golling by train, but there are also Taxis (although we don't
     know about the cost, make sure to ask). If you choose to take a rental car,
     Golling is very convenient to reach (~25min) from the airport: follow the
     A10 highway in direction of "Villach" and take the exit in Golling.

 - **Car:** Golling has its own highway exit and is therefore convenient to
     reach (for example: ~25min from Salzburg).

### What to do?

Let's be honest: Golling and its surroundings are a damn nice place. It's why
we're getting married there. **If you have the time: try to come a few days
early -- and let us know (use the comments section below)!** If we know that
people are there ahead of time, we'll try to organise fun stuff, like hiking or
a guided tour of Salzburg.

#### Golling

Golling is tiny, but it has lots to offer if you like hiking, cycling, or food.

##### **Salzach Gorge:**

A short (but stunning) hike is to take a bus to <a
href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=47.58421&mlon=13.18276#map=18/47.58421/13.18276"
target="_blank">Golling/Salzach Pichler</a>, walk across the Lammer river
bridge, walk up the hill, and see the "Salzach Öfen". The hiking path starts <a
href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=47.57985&mlon=13.18537#map=19/47.57985/13.18537">just
before the bridge accross the Salzach river</a>. The hiking path can be a bit
slippery when it's rainy, but you'll be rewarded, check out some pictures on the
<a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salzach%C3%B6fen" target="_blank">german
wikipedia page</a>.

##### **Bluntau Valley:**

A long, but flat hike (try to borrow a bike!) is to hike to the lakes in the <a
href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=47.5776&mlon=13.1396#map=16/47.5776/13.1396"
target="_blank">Bluntau valley</a>, a valley that has two beautiful lakes, lots
of forests, and is surrounded by mountains. In a recent TV show on Austrian
television, this was elected as one of the most beautiful places in the province
of Salzburg. We recommend to combine this with a stay at Golling's nicest beer
garden at <a href="http://www.gasthof-goellhof.at/" target="_blank">Gasthof
Göllhof</a> (<a
href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=47.58914&mlon=13.15219#map=19/47.58914/13.15219"
target="_blank">location</a>). For an Austrian speciality, try <a
href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%BClze" target="_blank">Sülze</a> --
essentially meat in aspic.

##### **Jochalmen/Stahlhaus:**

The Jochalmen are two cottages, quite high up in the mountains, where local
farmers keep their cows during the summer. The cheese that they make and sell
there is outstanding (really!), but doesn't even come close to the landscape.
Additionally, you will pass through the Bluntau valley (see above), which is a
sight in its own right. If the Jochalmen aren't enough of a challenge, you can
hike some more by walking all the way to the German border, where you'll find
the Stahlhaus, an alpine hut named after a guy called "Karl von Stahl". Can't
make this shit up. They serve food and drink and you can even stay there over
night.

**Achtung**, this is quite a hike, you should be moderately fit to attempt this.
If you make it to the upper Joch Alm on a mountain bike, Stephan will buy you a
drink (proof required: photo; and use a helmet!).

#### Around Golling

##### **Seewaldsee Lake:**

The <a
href="http://mein.salzburg.com/fotoblog/heimat/2014/08/der-seewaldsee-3.html"
target="_blank">Seewaldsee</a> lake is a lot nicer than its name is creative
("Seewaldsee" means lake-forest lake). It's a <a
href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=47.6270&mlon=13.2751#map=16/47.6270/13.2751"
target="_blank">few kilometres away</a> from Golling. You can bike there (if
you're sporty, it's quite high up and occasionally steep, but it's all good
roads) or take a car, there is a restaurant/cabin and it's a great place to take
a walk, hang out or even swim in the lake (Stephan refuses to swim there, due to
his pathological fear of the leeches in the water. YMMV).

##### **Werfen Ice Cave:**

Take a train to the town of Werfen (just a few stops), and hike up to <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eisriesenwelt" target="_blank">the world's
largest ice cave</a> (or simply take the cable car). Plan at least half a day.
The tours are quite something and two of Stephan's friends used to be tour
guides there when they were still students. Ask Georg (the guy with the big gun)
about the dragons. Also, both offered to give a tour there to our guests, so let
us know if you want to take them up on this offer!

#### Salzburg

![Salzburg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6d/Old_Town_Salzburg_across_the_Salzach_river.jpg)

Nearby Salzburg has a beautiful old town, a monastery full of jolly, beer
brewing monks (Stephan's favourite), clubs, concerts, pretty churches. Did we
mention the beer brewing monks?
