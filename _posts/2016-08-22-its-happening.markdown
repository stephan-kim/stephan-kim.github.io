We have known for a while, but it's official now: **we're getting married next
summer!** :) <3

The wedding will be on July 15th, 2017 in Golling (the village where Stephan
grew up). To those invited: we suggest you subscribe to the
[calendar](http://stephan.kim/calendar) in order to stay up to date (we'll use
this calendar to schedule all dates and locations of the wedding).

We're working on putting together some [travel info](/travel-info), especially for the
non-austrian visitors.
