We have known for a while, but it's official now: **we're getting married next
summer!** :) <3

The wedding will be on July 15th, 2016 in Golling (the village where Stephan
grew up). To those invited: we suggest you subscribe to the
[calendar](http://stephan.kim/calendar) in order to stay up to date (we'll use
this calendar to schedule all dates and locations of the wedding).

This post serves mainly as an early guide for those invited.

## The Location

The wedding will be in Golling's own castle, and the party will be at the
Berggasthof Bachrain restaurant.
