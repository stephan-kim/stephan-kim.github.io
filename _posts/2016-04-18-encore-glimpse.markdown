# Abstract

The age of multi-core computers is upon us, yet current programming
languages, typically designed for single-core computers and adapted
post hoc for multi-cores, remain tied to the constraints of a
sequential mindset and are thus in many ways inadequate. New
programming language designs are required that break away from this
old-fashioned mindset. To address this need, we have been developing
a new programming language called Encore, in the context of the
European Project UpScale. The paper presents a motivation for the
Encore language, examples of its main constructs, several larger
programs, a formalisation of its core, and a discussion of some
future directions our work will take. The work is ongoing and we
started more or less from scratch. That means that a lot of work has
to be done, but also that we need not be tied to decisions made for
sequential language designs. Any design decision can be made in
favour of good performance and scalability. For this reason, Encore
offers an interesting platform for future exploration into
object-oriented parallel programming.
